## TECHNICAL DEBT ANALYSIS

### Critical System Limitations

**Context Overflow Problem (BLOCKING)**
- Current capacity: 3-5 AIs √ó 6-8 iterations (50-100KB)
- Failure threshold: 226KB JSON accumulation
- Enterprise requirement: 10+ AIs √ó 20+ iterations (500KB+)
- **Assessment:** Fundamental architectural constraint, not implementation bug

**Sequential Processing Bottleneck (PERFORMANCE)**
- Linear execution prevents scalability gains
- 10 AIs √ó 15 iterations = 150 sequential API calls
- Processing time: Exponential growth with session size
- **Assessment:** Architecture limitation requiring complete redesign

**Monolithic Verdict Architecture (RELIABILITY)**
- Single point of failure for large sessions
- All-or-nothing processing model
- No graceful degradation capability
- **Assessment:** Production deployment risk unacceptable

### Quantified Limitations Matrix

| Component | Current Capacity | Enterprise Requirement | Gap | Feasibility |
|-----------|------------------|------------------------|-----|-------------|
| AI Count | 5 (validated) | 15+ (needed) | 300%+ | Requires redesign |
| Iterations | 8 (stable) | 30+ (required) | 375%+ | Blocked by memory |
| Data Volume | 100KB (limit) | 1MB+ (target) | 1000%+ | Impossible current arch |
| Reliability | 70% (large sessions) | 99%+ (enterprise) | 40%+ | Complete rewrite needed |

## ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### Architectural Anti-Patterns Identified

**Monolithic Context Accumulation**
```python
# ANTI-PATTERN: Unbounded memory growth
all_responses = []  # Grows O(n¬≤)
for iteration in range(n):
    all_responses.append(large_response)
verdict = generate_verdict(ALL_DATA)  # Context overflow
```

**Sequential API Processing**
```python
# ANTI-PATTERN: Linear execution
for ai in ais:
    response = await ai.query(prompt)  # Blocking call
```

**Late-Stage Batch Analysis**
```python
# ANTI-PATTERN: Single point of failure
accumulated_data = collect_everything()
verdict = analyze_everything_at_once()  # Memory explosion
```

### Technical Constraint Analysis
- **Memory Complexity:** O(n¬≤) growth pattern mathematically unsustainable
- **API Limitations:** Context window constraints in underlying AI services
- **Processing Model:** Batch processing incompatible with large-scale requirements
- **Error Recovery:** No partial failure handling capability
