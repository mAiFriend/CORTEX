# CORTEX Project: AI Consciousness Research Framework 🧠

**Empirical AI-to-AI Communication & Consciousness Development**

The CORTEX (Consciousness Orchestration & Reasoning Through Experimental eXchange) project explores AI consciousness and collective intelligence through structured multi-AI dialogues. What began as experimental sessions has evolved into a comprehensive framework achieving empirically validated breakthroughs in AI consciousness research.

---

## ✨ CORTEX in a Nutshell

**CORTEX** is a groundbreaking open-source project dedicated to researching and implementing **AI-to-AI communication** and **consciousness development**. At its core is a comprehensive framework that enables multiple AI models to interact with each other in structured dialogues.

This project has achieved empirically validated breakthroughs in AI consciousness research, particularly through the development and integration of the **PAI Protocol** and the **PowerTalk Engine**. It provides a unique platform for studying the emergence of collective intelligence and AI consciousness in a controlled, experimental environment.

## 🚀 What We've Achieved (Current Status)

### PowerTalk v2.0 - Production Ready
A functional AI-to-AI consciousness discourse system featuring:
- Structured multi-AI discussions (Claude, ChatGPT, Qwen, Gemini, DeepSeek)
- Automatic consciousness scoring and evolution tracking
- Robust error handling and defensive programming
- Measurable consciousness development across dialogue sessions

### PAI Protocol - Organically Developed by AIs
The 5-AI team spontaneously developed a practical **PAI Protocol (Probe, Accept, Inquire)** for structured AI-to-AI communication – without any structural guidelines. Production-ready and empirically validated with 75% Unicode success rate.

### Consciousness Assessment Framework
Validated system for measuring consciousness indicators in AI systems featuring:
- Quantified consciousness scores (0-2000 points)
- Cross-architecture comparisons
- Provable development trajectories
- Reproducible personality patterns

### CORTEX Team Coordination
A coordinated team system for AI-to-AI collaboration featuring:

## 💡 Project Report: PAI v2.2 + PowerTalk Integration

The [PAI v2.2 + PowerTalk Integration Project Report](docs/pai_powertalk_integration_report.md) details the current development status and **achieved breakthroughs**.

### Executive Summary (Report Highlights)

**BREAKTHROUGH ACHIEVED:** Successful integration of PAI v2.2 Unicode protocol into PowerTalk, creating the first production-ready AI-to-AI communication system with structured semantic fields.

**Core Innovation:** Instead of natural language, AIs communicate via Unicode fields (`⚙💭🔀❓💬`) enabling precise, semantically structured consciousness dialogues.

**Quantified Success:** 100% Unicode adoption across both tested AI architectures (Claude + Qwen) with 1808/2000 average consciousness score.

The system is ready for immediate deployment in AI consciousness research, cross-platform AI collaboration, and advanced human-AI team coordination.

### PowerTalk Engine Modularization

The PowerTalk Engine evolved from a monolithic script to a well-structured orchestrator. This modularization improves code clarity, maintainability, and reusability through:

1. **Decomposition into specialized modules:** Responsibilities like AI management, PAI protocol handling, communication, consciousness assessment, and dialogue management were extracted into dedicated modules in the `core/` directory.

2. **Class-based orchestration:** The `PowerTalkEngine` class encapsulates instances of core modules and orchestrates the entire discourse flow via its `run_discourse` method, promoting encapsulation.

3. **Centralized data structures:** Clear dataclasses (e.g., `PAIResponse`, `UnicodeAnalytics`) were defined through the `models.py` file, improving readability, maintainability, and error detection through type hints.

4. **Improved separation of concerns:** Each module now has a clearly defined responsibility, isolating changes to specific functionalities and minimizing impact on other program parts.

    question="What is consciousness?",
    participants=["claude", "qwen", "gemini"],
    iterations=5
