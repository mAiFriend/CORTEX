More context would help tailor the response.\n* Should the response be in German or English? While the request is in German, a simple confirmation like \"OK\" might be universally understood.\n* What constitutes a \"successful\" connection test in this context? Should the response indicate bandwidth, latency, or just a simple yes/no?\n\n\n\n\nGiven the limited information, the most intuitive and brief response is a simple confirmation.  Considering the German context,  \"OK\" or \"Ja\" (yes) would suffice.
